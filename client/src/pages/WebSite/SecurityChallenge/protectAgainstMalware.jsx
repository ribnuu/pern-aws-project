              The rise of ransomware

            <p className="text-gray-300 text-justify mb-4">
              Ransomware attacks, in particular, have increased rapidly in
              recent times and are now a ubiquitous threat to all organisations.
              By spreading quickly, locking down files and demanding a ransom
              for their decryption, ransomware is capable of causing significant
              disruption in a matter of minutes.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-justify mb-4">
              The WannaCry ransomware outbreak is just one high profile example
              of an attack that caused widespread disruption, affecting over
              200,000 organisations in 150 countries. Cybercriminals can
              instigate attacks like these using basic and easily accessible
              components, highlighting the need for organisations to keep
              software patched, improve employee cyber awareness and detect
              malicious activity in its infancy.
