This query deletes records from the stock_transaction_update table where there isn't a corresponding bill_number in the stock_bill_header table.
It works by checking each record in stock_transaction_update and ensuring that for each transaction_id, there is a matching bill_number in the stock_bill_header table. 
If no match is found, the record in stock_transaction_update is removed.
DELETE FROM stock_transaction_update
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM stock_bill_header
    WHERE stock_bill_header.bill_number = stock_transaction_update.transaction_id
);


This query updates the created_at and updated_at timestamps in the stock_transaction_update table.

records where the transaction_id in stock_transaction_update matches the bill_number in stock_bill_header.
UPDATE stock_transaction_update
SET
    created_at = stock_bill_header.created_at,
    updated_at = stock_bill_header.updated_at
FROM stock_bill_header
WHERE stock_transaction_update.transaction_id = stock_bill_header.bill_number;
